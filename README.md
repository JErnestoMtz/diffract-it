# diffract-it

`diffract-it` is an open source computational optics simulation program. The main objective of `diffract-it` is to make a capable optics simulation program  as user friendly as possible, including a graphical user interface `GUI` that allows people with zero coding experience to use it.


## What can it do?

Diffract-it can calculate and plot the **diffraction pattern for an arbitrary shaped apertures**, as well as the propagation path.

### Examples:
**Diffraction of a square aperture**

**Double slid diffraction and propagation**

**Hex grid diffraction at different distances**

**Multi intensity diffraction**

## Easy to use

There are two main ways to run `diffract-it`: 

**Option 1: Cloning this repository and running `main.py`.**

* Required packages: `numpy`,`matplotlib`, `Pillow`, `opencv-python` 


**Option 2: Executable file, this option doesn’t require any dependencies.** 

* To use this option you need to clone or download the branch `executable` and run `diff.èxe`

## Further development.

DIffract-it is an ongoing project, with many more features being developed. 

1. Improving GUI 
2. Direct Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction calculations
3. Polychromatic diffraction
4. Angular spectrum method as an alternative to Fourier wave propagation.
5. Selectable resolution
6. Addition of lenses and other optic components
7. Documentation
